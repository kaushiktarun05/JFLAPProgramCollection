## Introduction

JFLAPProgramCollection provides JFLAP files and exercises for:

1. **Finite Automata**: Deterministic (DFA) and Non-Deterministic (NFA) finite automata.
2. **Regular Expressions**: Converting regular expressions to finite automata and vice versa.
3. **Context-Free Grammars**: Designing and analyzing context-free grammars.
4. **Pushdown Automata**: Creating and simulating pushdown automata.
5. **Turing Machines**: Building and testing Turing machines.
6. **Other Automata Theory Topics**: Exploring various concepts in automata theory using JFLAP.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine and follow the instructions below.

## Prerequisites
